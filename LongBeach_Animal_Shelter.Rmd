1. How has the number of per adoptions changed over years ?

2. Which type of pets are adopted most often ?

# Data Preparation
library(lubridate)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(tidytuesdayR)

tuesdata <- tidytuesdayR::tt_load(2025, week = 9)
adoptions <- tuesdata$longbeach
str(adoptions)

adoptions$Date <- as.Date(adoptions$outcome_date, format = "%Y-%m-%d")
adoptions$Year <- year(adoptions$Date)

# Question 1:

adoptions_by_year <- adoptions %>%
  group_by(Year) %>%
  summarise(TotalAdoptions = n()) %>%
  arrange(Year)
print(adoptions_by_year) # summary tables

ggplot(adoptions_by_year, aes(x = Year, y = TotalAdoptions)) + 
  geom_line(color = "darkblue", size = 1) +
  geom_point(color = "red", size = 2) +
  labs(title = "Number of Animals Adoptions Over The Years",
       x = "Year",
       y = "Total Adoptions") +
  theme_minimal()

# Question 2: 

adoptions_by_pet <- adoptions %>%
  group_by(animal_type) %>%
  summarise(TotalAdoptions = n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(TotalAdoptions))
print(adoptions_by_pet)

ggplot(adoptions_by_pet, aes(x = reorder(animal_type, TotalAdoptions), y = TotalAdoptions)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "steelblue") +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(title = "Most Adopted Animal Types",
       x = "Animal Type",
       y = "Number of Adoptions") +
