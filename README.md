# PROJECT
In recent years, the availability of public open data has significantly transformed how we approach research and analysis, opening up countless opportunities for everyone from students to professionals. Government agencies, school, and organizations across various fields are sharing large amounts of data whether it's about health, the environment, or cities. By picking topics that interest me or are relevant to current issues, I dive into these datasets, whether it's from government websites or research communities, and bring them to life through analysis. Using methods I have learned, such as correlation analysis, data visualizations, and even regression modeling, I work to uncover hidden relationships between variables that shed light on the deeper questions we might not see at first glance. More importantly, I aim to understand the stories within the data to find connections that might go unnoticed without careful observation.
